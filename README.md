 # TESTING
 

#### Validator Testing and Unfix Bug
         
w3c html validator

        I have encountered so many errors in my Html codes.
        Here are some of the following errors that I made
          1. I have made either an additional symbols that my code does not need.
          2. My code did not run properly for I wrote the wrong symbol or that I forgot to add a symbol in my code. Like for example a . in the begining of my img code.
          3. I have duplicate my attributes to the code.
          4. The validator can see and end tag but could not see my open tag
          5. My element name could not be named as a child element
          6. A section lacks a heading.
Most of this I have solve but some I have encountered I have still to solve. 
The following problems I have yet to solve:

          No.4. I believe my open tag is too far away from the closing tag that is why the validator can not find it. 
          No. 5 The element is part of the form code and the other codes worked properly only for one part.

          
          
        



         
W3C Css validator

        I used w3c css validator for my code and I got one error, The error was that only a 0 can have not unit.
        If my code has a number it should have a unit.

        Problem not solve since the code I am using here are the following
        flex: 1;
        order: 1;
        column-count: 1;

    If I have more time and been able to research more I would have made more corrections to the mistake I have made in my code.
